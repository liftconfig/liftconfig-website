# Office Setup

Since working from home I've been upgrading my office setup with an emphasis on ergonomics. I believe in investing in high quality tools to make time spent working and studying more productive and enjoyable.

## Equipment

### Laptop: MacBook Pro

The Apple ARM processors are workhorses and I use the high quality 16" retina display as a secondary monitor.

### Monitor: Apple Studio Display

I spent a long time researching monitors and eventually ended up with ASD for the following reasons:

1. The screen is primarily used for productivity. I spend the majority of my time in a terminal or IDE so picture quality, text sharpness, and brightness are my primary concerns.
2. There are limited 5K/6K monitor options on the market. These high resolutions both look great and allow macOS to scale efficiently.
3. When using the monitor with the MBP it wakes from sleep almost instantly, and you can control the monitor functions (brightness, volume) using the native macOS controls.
4. Integrated speakers, webcam, and 4 port dock. The speakers are great considering they are built into the monitor. The webcam not so much, but it's still fine for online meetings.
5. Apple support is second to none. I've heard nightmare stories trying to get support from Samsung, LG etc.

Before the ASD my monitor setup consisted of 2x 28" 4K Samsung monitors. The reduction in screen real estate is a downside, but I have found less neck strain since removing the 28" side monitor and the display quality is far superior. However, I would consider upgrading to a 32" 6K display if a reasonable priced option becomes available.

On the rear of the ASD I've added a [LED light strip](https://www.amazon.com.au/PAUTIX-Dimmable-Backlight-Flexible-Lighting/dp/B0B1J57XS9?th=1) for back lighting. This provides excellent relief from eye strain is recommended for anyone working in the evening.

### Tablet: iPad 10.9"

This is used with sidecar for extra screen real estate. Usually I'll keep Teams or Outlook open on the iPad. Being able to disconnect it at the end of the day and use it as a regular tablet is also a big benefit. I've found it's an invaluable tool for studying on the go.

### Headphones: AirPods Pro

I've been using these since they were released in 2019. Active noise cancellation is a must when working from home or a busy office. The battery life, sound quality, and portability mean they are my go-to headphones for both work and study.

### Keyboard: Dygma Raise

I first stumbled across the Raise when researching ergonomic keyboards. Split keyboards allow the wrists and shoulders to stay in a more natural position. I use the raise for the following reasons:

1. It uses a standard keyboard layout. I didn't want the pain of switching between something more customised like the ZSA Moonlander and a regular keyboard.
2. It has great software for modifying keys, layers, and macros.
3. It has a tenting kit 
4. Hot swappable mechanical switches. I originally ordered the Raise with Kailh Silent Browns. They weren't bad, but I've found my preference is for a silent tactile switch. I'm currently using [Outemu Cream yellows](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004669940336.html). 

> For anyone starting with a split/ergo keyboard, I highly recommend [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) for getting your touch typing back up to speed. There's some great funbox modes which can hit any weak points in your typing game. I personally like the wiki mode which gives a more real-world typing test.

### Trackball: Ploopy Classic

Due to my [HOTAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOTAS) inspired keyboard & chair setup I had to use a trackpad or trackball. I did initially test the Magic Trackpad, but I found it annoying and slow for mouse heavy tasks. When researching trackballs, I found Ploopy had some excellent reviews praising both it's build quality (high quality switches) and ergonomics. The design is essentially an upgraded replica of the Microsoft Trackball Explorer. I'm now a fan, using it both at home and in the office. MacOS SteerMouse is a must when using a trackball as it allows you to customise everything about the device, as well as add per app behaviour and macros. Autoscroll is also a game changer as it enables 2D scrolling using the trackball when a button is held down. SteerMouse will allow you to adjust the autoscroll scrolling speed independent of the standard mouse cursor speed.

### Chair: Hermon Miller Aeron

Remastered edition size C with the aftermarket Atlas headrest and rollerblade wheels. Aerons are a gold standard in the ergonomic chair world due to their level of customisation. I found the post in this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ergonomics/comments/q6xmju/ive_been_having_a_lot_of_neck_and_back_pain_im/) by a HM product manager to be the most useful explanation of how to properly set up the chair. I typically use it with the tilt adjuster unlocked (for that floating feeling) in a 90 degree upright position. I mainly use the headrest as a guide to feel where my head and neck should be to try and limit [forward head posture](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Forward_Head_Posture), rather than to support my head.

The following components are used in the keyboard mount setup:

- 2x [Bracket Pole Mount Double Arm](https://au.element14.com/pro-signal/1290b/bracket-pole-mount-double-arm/dp/278225201?st=bracket%20pole%20mount%20double%20arm)
- 2x [Steel VESA TV mount bracket](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07MJTJ6T4?ref_=pe_19115062_429603572_302_E_DDE_dt_1&th=1)

This [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotas/comments/mmmyp2/herman_miller_aeron_diy_mounts_with_quick_release/) provides assembly details.

Prior to this setup I did try using an adjustable keyboard tray, but I found it didn't work for me. Ergonomics need to be tailored for the individuals body type and limb proportions. Having longer arms and a relatively short torso I found my legs would be touching the underside of a traditional tray or desk, but my forearms and wrists would still have to angle upwards putting pressure on the ulnar nerve in the forearm. With a split keyboard on the above mounts I can use the keyboard in a tented position slightly lower than the Aeron's arm rests. This allows the chest to open up, the shoulders & upper back to sit against the chair back, and the arms to remain in a supinator position with forearms aligned with the wrists. In this position, the arms and wrists are floating above the keyboard with the keys directly below the fingertips. I've made many minor adjustments to the angles and heights of the monitor arms and brackets over time, and I believe these seemingly small changes are worth thinking about when you're spending a significant portion of your working life seated at a desk.

### Monitor Mount: Brateck dual wall mount

The desk is flush with the wall (it's an IKEA kitchen benchtop) so I use a Brateck dual wall mounted monitor arm 17"-32". Installed on one of the arms is a [VESA laptop tray holder](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/174574651488) which holds the MPB.
